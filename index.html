<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<h2> A little about me... </h2>
	<p>My name is Angel L. Escalante. I am a 16 year old latino American. I live with both of my parents, my older brother and my younger brother. I attend high school in New York State. In this program I aim to learn some new skills relating to different tech-based occupations. I like to spend my time watching anime, playing video games, going for a ride on my bike and going to the park with friends. I am a huge fan of Nintendo and have been playing Nintendo games for as long as I can remember. Due to this, Nintendo has become one of the largest influences in my life. This website was made to be somewhat of a reflection on the impact Nintndo has left on me. This will show off some of my favorite games produced by the company. I know that many people are very skeptical about Nintendo games and would rather play XBox or Playstation, to them I say...</p>

	<p> I am a very dedicated gamer and Nintendo fan. If for some reason you are reluctant to play any Nintendo video games, I highly reccomend you reconsider. As a company that has been around for decades Nintendo has served to supply people such as myself with entertaining video games. If you want to enjoy games such as Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and Pokemon, Nintendo is the only way to do it. I'm not saying that Nintendo is perfect for everybody but you should try it out anyway. As a company that virtually single-handely made the gaming industry what it is today, Nintendo has been working to make fun games for all ages. In the words of the late president of Nintendo, "Video games are meant to be one thing. Fun. Fun for everyone."
